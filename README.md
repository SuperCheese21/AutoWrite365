# AutoWrite365
For those people who are too lazy to write 365 words a day.

## INSTALL

To use this script you will need to install Tampermonkey for your web browser. https://tampermonkey.net/

Once Tampermonkey is installed, click on the file "aw365_v0.1.x.user.js" and select "Raw". Tampermonkey should automatically pop up prompting you to install the userscript. Click install to continue.

## USAGE

Every time you load the Entry page on the Write365 website, words will automatically fill the text entry box. Sentences will not be gramatically correct, of course, but real words are used and put in a logical order.
